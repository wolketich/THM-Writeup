- This cookies_and_milk.txt file looks like a modified rendition of a DirtyCow exploit, usually written in C. Find a copy of that original file online, and get it on the target box. You can do this with some simple file transfer methods like netcat, or spinning up a quick Python HTTP server... or you can simply copy-and-paste it into a text editor on the box!
