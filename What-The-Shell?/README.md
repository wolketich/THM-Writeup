- What is the syntax for setting up an OPENSSL-LISTENER using the tty technique from the previous task? Use port 53, and a PEM file called "encrypt.pem"

	- `socat OPENSSL-LISTENER:53,cert=encrypt.pem,verify=0 FILE:'tty',raw,echo=0`

- If your IP is 10.10.10.5, what syntax would you use to connect back to this listener?
