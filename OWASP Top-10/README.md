# OWASP Top 10

This room breaks each OWASP topic down and includes details on what the vulnerability is, how it occurs and how you can exploit it. You will put the theory into practise by completing supporting challenges.


  - Injection
  - Broken Authentication
  - Sensitive Data Exposure
  - XML External Entity
  - Broken Access Control
  - Security Misconfiguration
  - Cross-site Scripting
  - Insecure Deserialization
  - Components with Known Vulnerabilities
  - Insufficent Logging & Monitoring

The room has been designed for beginners and assume no previous knowledge of security.

- Hack into the webapp, and find the flag!

	- *disclaimer* Here I found another way to enter. Analyzing the source code of the application, in particular the `login.js` and `cookie.js` I found out that the only Authentication is based on the cookie with name `SessionToken`, so adding that cookie I can enter inside `/mynotes` page. But then, I didn't found anything weird.
	- Googling `Pensive notes source code` you will find a reposiory on GitHub.

	After downloading and compiling PensiveNotes, log in using the default credentials pensive:PensiveNotes
	Make sure you change this password immediately!

	- Insert your IP inside the file `rce.py`.
	- `python3 rce.py`
	- This will output the encoded payload.
	- Copy and paste this as value of "Encodedpayload" cookie.
	- Make sure that your nc connection is still running.
	- Refresh the page.
