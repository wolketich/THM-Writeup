Before we begin, we're going to need to deploy two Instances:

	2. The vulnerable Instance attached to this task by pressing the "Deploy" button at the top-right of this task/day.

	- `3`

- Now how many "shares" are there on the Samba server?

	- `4`

- Use smbclient to try to login to the shares on the Samba server (10.10.151.244). What share doesn't require a password?

	- `smbclient //<TARGET_IP>/<SHARE>`
	- `tbfc-santa`

- Log in to this share, what directory did ElfMcSkidy leave for Santa?
